-- | `APoll` is the more general type of `Poll`, which is parameterized
-- | over some underlying `event` type.
-- |
-- | Normally, you should use `Poll` instead, but this type
-- | can also be used with other types of events, including the ones in the
-- | `Semantic` module.
newtype APoll event a = APoll (forall b. event (a -> b) -> event b)

-- | A `Poll` acts like a survey or poll. We get a series of questions in time
-- | of form `a -> b`, and we respond with `b`.
-- |
-- | We can construct a sample a `Poll` from some `Event`, combine `Poll`s
-- | using `Applicative`, and sample a final `Poll` on some other `Event`.
